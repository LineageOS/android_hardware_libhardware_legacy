      "message": "Which ones - QCOM_FM_ENABLED, QCOM_NEW_FM or both?\n\nIf QCOM_NEW_FM - it was supposed to seperate the old FM volume API that was cherry-picked from MR1 from the new one for MR2, so both could be supported. However, due to a bunch of stuff missing in frameworks/av, compiling with the old one doesn\u0027t even work, so in that sense all of this is useless yes.",
